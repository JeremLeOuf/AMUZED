# AMUZED Mission

So, what is the AMUZED mission exactly? The mission is based on three pillars.

**AMUZED wants to build an enthusiastic and passionate community that supports, promotes and most importantly enjoys the product and engages in NFT education and collection.**&#x20;

Looking at the current development of NFTs, it is very likely that eventually all kinds of things will be tokenized and connected by blockchain. Even though the world is still at the very beginning of this movement, AMUZED wants to make sure that everyone can already gain access to this technology. AMUZED is not something made only for “crypto heads” or “bitcoin millionaires”. Neither is AMUZED a closed circle for people who already have wallets and own cryptocurrency. In fact, there is no need to know anything about NFTs when first using AMUZED. It is helping to integrate NFTs as viable items in the music industry – while also opening the door for every music fan interested in it.&#x20;

For example, AMUZED will use limitations of 1000, 100 and 10 tokens as well as introduce a rare unique card for each artist token series. While due to the principle of demand and offer, limitation will drive prices up by default, AMUZED also wants to ensure that there is enough offer of less limited tokens which are priced fairly. Tokens should be affordable for everyone.&#x20;

&#x20;

**AMUZED wants to construct a secure & user-friendly product that users love to use on a daily basis – thereby striving for technical excellence while also opening the door for NFT mass adoption.**&#x20;

By choosing to integrate a hot wallet to the AMUZED platform, in combination with a ramp-on solution that directly enables users to transfer fiat money (i.e. government-issued currencies) to their AMUZED wallet, AMUZED is building the bridge that closes the gap between the NFT space and “regular” internet consumers – by not obliging any user to already have a wallet with paid-in crypto currency set up beforehand. In the future, likely no one will get around the arising crypto world. AMUZED wants to serve as first mover to open doors and enable mass adoption.&#x20;

That being said, [security](../infrastructure/amuzed-wallet/security.md) also plays a major role in the development of the AMUZED platform, as the user needs to be in a position to fully trust the product in order to enjoy it.

**AMUZED wants to focus on community-driven, organic user growth paired with continuous artist onboarding – creating sustainable scale-up.**&#x20;

The aim is to grow the user base organically – triggered by user word-of-mouth, or via artists that are promoting AMUZED to their followers. AMUZED has created various communication channels and social media platforms to gather a diverse community – artists, music fans, crypto enthusiasts and those that do not see fit in any of the previously mentioned. AMUZED is for everyone.&#x20;

By onboarding artists and launching tokens in an ongoing matter, AMUZED intends to reach critical size and therefore have an impact on the broader music industry, leading to activation of more and more artists. This in turn prompts further user growth and increasing traction as well as activity in the AMUZED ecosystem – a dynamic circle that sees constant scale up.
