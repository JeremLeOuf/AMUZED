# Token Issuance

When new artists are announced by AMUZED, the tokens will not be available all at once on the AMUZED primary market. Instead, it is a slow issuing process. What does that mean? \
The 1111 tokens for each artists are not issued and available on the same day but are spread over the course of roughly **1 year**.&#x20;

That means that on average 3 tokens per artists are newly issued on the primary marketplace every day.&#x20;

The auction time is variable (see [Auction Process](../marketplace/primary-marketplace/auction-process.md)); however, the standard auctioning time (countdown until 0 seconds) is 3 days for every token.&#x20;
