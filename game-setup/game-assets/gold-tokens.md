# Gold Tokens

![Overview of Gold Token Features](../../.gitbook/assets/Card\_Explain\_Gold.png)

There are 100 different Gold Tokens per artist that are going to be created.

### **Token Infrastructure**

These token are Non-fungible token (NFTs) that are based on the ERC-721 token standard and can be clearly authenticated on the blockchain. Therefore, each AMUZED user that owns such a token can be transparently authenticated as the real owner on the blockchain.&#x20;

### **Token Design**

There are 10 features on the token for users to explore:

* Artist Photo
* Artist Name
* Unique Serial Number
* Rarity Watermark
* Token Category
* AMUZED Monogram
* Genre
* Barcode
* Special Edition Note
* Soundwave

#### **Artist Photo**

The artist photo is the center of attention on the token itself. Therefore AMUZED put a lot of effort in working together with the artist to create the best possible picture for the token and create a new shot that fans have not seen before.&#x20;

#### Artist Name

The name of each artist is also a main focal point on the token itself and obviously also plays a major role in the underlying smart contract itself to differentiate the token on the blockchain to other artists.&#x20;

#### Unique Serial Number&#x20;

Each token of each rarity has a unique serial number -> for example: 7/1000 or 69/100. This differentiates the token not only between rarities but also within the own rarity category.&#x20;

#### Rarity Watermark

The rarity watermark is designed to work as a visual stamp of verification or rarity. The watermark is the AMUZED company icon.&#x20;

#### Token Category

The color stripe and name denote the respective token category

#### AMUZED Monogram

The AMUZED Monogram is a beautifully designed pattern of the company icon that has the identical color as the token category. The monogram adds additional depth to the card.&#x20;

#### Genre

The genre in which the respective artist is active in (e.g. Rap). The classification by genre is also very important to the AMUZED gameplay.&#x20;

#### Barcode

The barcode serves as another "easter egg" for users and owners.

#### Special Edition Note

The token is the first of its kind to be dropped by the artist in collaboration with AMUZED and therefore is part of the "First Mint Edition"

#### Soundwave

Each artist selects his/her favourite song from his lineup of songs. This song will be encoded into a unique soundwave for each artist and displayed on the trading card.&#x20;
