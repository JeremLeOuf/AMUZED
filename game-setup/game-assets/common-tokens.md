# Common Tokens

![Common Card in the AMUZED Game](<../../.gitbook/assets/Card\_Explain\_Common (1).png>)

During the onboarding to the AMUZED Game, users will receive automatically 7 Common tokens randomly attributed to them. They can use these free common tokens to start playing the game for free or use a mix of authenticated and common tokens. AMUZED offers these common tokens to substantially lower to barrier to entry for new users and facilitate inclusive gameplay.&#x20;

In contrast to the authenticated tokens (Glass, Gold, Platinum, Diamond), common tokens are not minted and do not live on the Polygon blockchain: hence, they are not real NFTs. They are also not limited in quantity per artist, and **can not** be bought or sold by AMUZED users. The common tokens are just created and attributed to the users in order to enhance the initial game experience.\
However, common tokens are still in-game assets that can be seen in the user's collection page, and of course also used in some AMUZED game tournaments.&#x20;

#### **The Token**

The common token is a transparent trading card that represents a music artist in the AMUZED game. On the token itself there are some features that are relevant to the game and some that are relevant for collectible purposes:&#x20;

Game relevant features on the card:

* **Genre**
* **Token Category**: Common - This clearly differentiates the common token from authenticated tokens and has some restrictions in the AMUZED game.&#x20;
* **Artist Name**

Non-Game relevant features:&#x20;

* **Unique Soundwave**: Each artist selects his/her favourite song from his lineup of songs. This song will be encoded into a unique soundwave for each artist and displayed on the trading card.&#x20;
