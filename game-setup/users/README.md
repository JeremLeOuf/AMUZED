# Users

There are different kinds of users on the AMUZED platform.&#x20;

* Collectors (want to collect from their favourite artist)
* Players (want to actively play the AMUZED Game)
* Scouts (scout upcoming artist for future returns)

AMUZED wants to be a place for all of them.&#x20;

Each user has a dedicated profile page, where they can showcase their collectibles, see their recent activities, have an overview of their favourite artists and tokens.&#x20;

Users will be able to follow other users, to see what other users are up to and see what lineups they submitted in the last week. This encourages users to interact more closely with each other and create a tight AMUZED community and ecosystem.&#x20;
