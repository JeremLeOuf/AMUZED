# Music  Artists

AMUZED partners up with music artists around the globe to create unique digital collectibles in the form of trading cards that enable their fans to experience a new form of collecting and allows them to indirectly share in the artist's success by using these trading cards in the AMUZED game.&#x20;

Each music artist is unique. That's why also each partnership between the artist and AMUZED is unique. Some artist might just cooperate with AMUZED to allow for transfer of copyright for pictures, while others connect unique experiences (such as a private concert) to their respective tokens.&#x20;

AMUZED is not only simply licensing the artist, but is actively cooperating with them. This means that they are also actively engaged on Social Media or even play the game themselves. And the artist takes center stage: He or she becomes the hero at AMUZED. The fan community is growing steadily, and fans are seemingly tied closer to their idols. AMUZED is giving the artist a ticket for novel ways to entertain. And after all, this is what artists are: They are entertainers. An unprecedented and original experience will be created, potentially creating THE contemporary form of artist establishment, where grand amusement is the main driver.&#x20;

Each artist has their own dedicated "artist page" on the AMUZED platform, where fans can learn about them and get new insights.&#x20;

#### Artist Stats & News

The artist page is very important for the users to keep being up-to-date and informed on what the artist is doing, and how the artist performed in the last weeks tournaments. Therefore, the user is able to see the natural score of the respective artists over the last 5 tournament weeks as additional information that is important to the game, such as news clippings that mention the artist, overview of newest song releases and song features and more.&#x20;

Users are also able to inspect the past weekly score more closely when clicking on one of the last performances, where they will see how the respective weekly score was calculated. For example: 69 points (75 points music streaming, 64 social media points).&#x20;

They are also able to follow the price development for the artist tokens and can make informed buying & selling decisions based on the data.&#x20;

#### Artist Tiers

There are 4 tiers that artists belong to based on their social media following, streaming performance and overall fame (**this is defined by AMUZED and is not public to users or artists**).

* X-tier Artists (The Superstars)
* A-tier artists (Really good performing artists)
* B-tier artists (Average performing artists)&#x20;
* C-tier (below average performing artists)&#x20;

The tier is not important to users or artists and has no impact on the game itself; however, it is important for the [reward system](../gameplay/reward-system.md), so that the best users also receive the most sought after rewards.&#x20;
