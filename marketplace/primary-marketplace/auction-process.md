# Auction Process

#### Auction Duration

The auction length can vary across different tokens; however, the standard auction duration is **3 days** for any token on the primary marketplace.&#x20;

#### Auction Logic

Everyday 3 new tokens from each artist will be picked at random from all tokens and are added to the primary marketplace for sale at a random time of the day.&#x20;

As stated in the [pricing pool](../../gameplay/reward-system.md#price-pool) section, not all cards will be available for sale, but some are reserved for user rewards -> 890 will be available for every artist (800 Glass / 90 Gold / 9 Platinum / 1 Diamond).&#x20;

#### Winning Bid

The winning bid is the highest bid at the end of the auction i.e. when the countdown hits 0 seconds.

#### Last Minute Bid

When a new highest bid is entered during the last minute of an auction, the countdown will be extended by one extra minute, in order to give other users a chance again to increase their bid.&#x20;

#### Cancelation of Bid

When a user has entered a bid it is final! The user is not able to cancel his bid, even when he has done a mistake and he entered a value that is too high. Furthermore, there are no refunds possible. Therefore, the user has to make sure that he has entered the right amount and really wants to place a bid -> **To increase safety, users have to type in their password again before placing the bid.**
