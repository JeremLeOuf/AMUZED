#### Selling/Buying Process

When a user owns a token (and is displayed in his collection), he is able to sell his token on the secondary marketplace in exchange for ETH. In order to do that, he needs to visit the respective token page of the token he would like to sell and select the _**List My Card**_ Button. Afterwards a widget opens up, where the user can select the sale price. After selecting the sale price, the seller clicks on the _**List Token**_ Button and the token will be displayed to other users on the secondary marketplace.&#x20;

The Listing duration is set at **3 days** and can not be changed by the user. When the 3 days are over and the token has not been sold to another user, the seller needs to list the token again.&#x20;
