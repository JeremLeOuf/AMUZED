# Ramp-On

**AMUZED has partnered up with Ramp to enable users with an easy onboarding process into the realm of crypto by facilitating easy conversion from FIAT to Crypto currency**

Ramp is an entirely new type of on-ramp: aggregating various sources of liquidity and payment methods to give AMUZED users the on-ramping process they deserve. Ramp runs on open banking rails, meaning that users can use a direct connection to a bank API to get verified in seconds and pay with crypto.&#x20;

There are mainly three ways in which AMUZED users can convert their FIAT currency and deposit ETH into their wallet:&#x20;

1. **Via Open Banking**
2. **Via Credit Cards & Apple Pay**
3. **Via SEPA Transfer (for holder with an EUR bank account)**

The process that users have to walk through to convert crypto is very simple and made even simpler by the AMUZED wallet connection, as the currency and wallet address is automatically filled in. This means the user only has to select the correct amount and in some cases provide some verification documents.&#x20;

Once the user has gone through the Ramp process of converting currency, their respective amount is automatically shown in the AMUZED Wallet Balance. From this point forward the user is able to transact on the AMUZED platform.&#x20;
