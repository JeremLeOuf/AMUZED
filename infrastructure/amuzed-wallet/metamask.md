# MetaMask

#### MetaMask Explained

MetaMask is a digital wallet that can be used to deposit users ETH into the AMUZED wallet. The MetaMask wallet is a plugin extension that lives within the web browser which can interact with the blockchain.

#### Bridging

When opening a MetaMask the default network is the Ethereum Mainnet, which means that usually the ETH already in a users wallet can not be transferred directly to the AMUZED wallet but first needs to be bridged to the Polygon Chain (Matic Mainnet). There are a couple of ways users can do this:&#x20;

* The most common one is the Polygon Bridge. The polygon bridge is easy to use, but users will incur higher gas fees due to the Ethereum Mainnet transfer.&#x20;
* Another, perhaps better, option is to use the gasless transfer provider Hyphen (AMUZED aims to integrate this feature in the application in the future)

#### Deposit to AMUZED Wallet

Once the ETH on the user's MetaMask is bridged to the Polygon Chain, he is able to connect his wallet with the AMUZED platform and transfer ETH to his AMUZED wallet.

#### User Widget

As this can be a complicated process users will be guided through the process by providing links to the Hyphen website and showing of the AMUZED wallet address in a simple way:
