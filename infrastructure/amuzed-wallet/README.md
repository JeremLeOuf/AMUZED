# AMUZED Wallet

The AMUZED wallet is one of the cornerstones of the whole platform. The wallet keeps the usersâ€™ digital assets (NFTs & ETH) secure and enables them to participate in the game, as well as operate on the integrated marketplace.&#x20;

AMUZED has partnered up with Venly to offer users the easiest and best custodial wallet solution.

Whilst logged in to AMUZED, users simply click on the wallet icon located in the top right hand corner of the screen. Clicking on the wallet icon will initiate the AMUZED wallet to slide out.

It gets automatically created for the user during the initial registration process and allows for automatic storing of the digital assets, as well as a simplified Ramp-on process (with pre-filled information), and an easy MetaMask connection.&#x20;

The AMUZED wallet is powered by the Polygon Network, which substantially increases the user experience through faster and cost-efficient transactions. Furthermore, it is a custodial wallet, which means that the user does not have to worry about private key storage or recovery phrases, but can enjoy the full beauty of the AMUZED platform.&#x20;

In order to be able to transact on the AMUZED platform, such as bidding on newly issued tokens or buying, selling, and trading on the secondary marketplace, users have to use the provided hot wallet.&#x20;
