# Withdrawal of Assets

The digital assets that are held in the AMUZED wallet (NFTs & ETH) can be withdrawn by transferring them to a different wallet.&#x20;

#### **ETH Withdrawal**&#x20;

For withdrawing ETH the process is fairly simple. Users just click on the "Send ETH" button in the AMUZED wallet and a widget will open up that allows users to enter any Ethereum or Polygon address and the amount they would like to withdraw:&#x20;

#### **NFT Withdrawal**

Withdrawing of Game Assets (Glass, Gold, Platinum, Diamond Tokens) is also possible on the AMUZED platform however the process is slightly different:

Here users first have to go the the specific token page, which they want to withdraw. In the blockchain details section of the user's artist's card page, they can select the _**Withdraw to external Wallet**_ button. When clicking this button a widget will open up that allows users to enter a Polygon address to which the token will be transferred.&#x20;
