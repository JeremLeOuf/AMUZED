# MATIC Gas Tank

MATIC is the native token that powers the Polygon Network (see [Currency](amuzed-wallet/currency-eth.md) for more) and needs to be paid for each transaction.&#x20;

To simplify the onboarding process for new users and at the same time minimise friction for all users, AMUZED has set up a "MATIC Gas Tank" that is used for all of the transaction on the AMUZED platform.&#x20;

**How does that work exactly?**&#x20;

In a nutshell the "MATIC Gas Tank" is a Polygon Wallet that is owned by AMUZED and holds MATIC tokens.&#x20;

Each time a user signs a transaction the respective MATIC amount (gas fee) is not deducted from the user's wallet but instead from the AMUZED gas tank.&#x20;
