# Blockchain

As AMUZED is entirely customer-centric, we wanted to create a web3 product that is still super easy to handle for any user. Therefore, the underlying blockchain technology is of paramount importance with respect to security, gas fees, and transaction times.&#x20;

The **AMUZED platform is powered by Polygon** (previously Matic Network). Polygon is a protocol and a framework for building and connecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks, such as Ethereum sidechains and rollup solutions.

Specifically, AMUZED is built on the Polygon PoS Chain, an EVM-compatible ethereum sidechain, secured by a permissionless set of PoS validators and checkpoints submitted to Ethereum. This chain allows AMUZED to make much faster transactions on our platform and reduces gas fees to a minimum, while still remaining a very high level of security.&#x20;

The native currency of the Polygon Chain is [$MATIC](https://coinmarketcap.com/de/currencies/polygon/). For each transaction on the Polygon chain, minimal gas fees occur that are settled in Polygon's native currency. The amount of gas fees ([Gas Price](https://polygonscan.com/gastracker)) that need to be paid in order to make sure a transaction goes through depends on the block space on the chain vs. the current demand (i.e. transactions that need to be validated). These gas fees are usually paid by the specific party that initiates the transaction. In our case, however, AMUZED is covering all gas fees for its users on the primary and secondary market place.&#x20;
