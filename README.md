**AMUZED is building a fantasy music manager game with an integrated marketplace for its in-game assets (Non Fungible Tokens).**

The game is designed to provide the users with a fun experience by collecting digital assets of music artists to participate in weekly tournaments and compete against other users by applying their insights in the music industry. The game itself is closely intertwined with the real-life musical performance of the artists and therefore allows fans to indirectly share in the success of their collected artists.&#x20;

AMUZED aims to be the most intuitive and easy-to-use web3 platform. To achieve this the platform is powered by Polygon, which is a decentralised platform that provides faster and almost gas-less transactions with the security and safety of the blockchain. Furthermore, during the signup process an AMUZED wallet is automatically created for each user, which allows for a simplified onboarding process and easier user experience on the AMUZED platform. Users can deposit ETH into their AMUZED wallet either via a Ramp-on solution (converting fiat to crypto) or a transfer from another third-party wallet namely MetaMask. Once there are funds in the users AMUZED wallet ETH Balance on the Polygon network, users are free to buy, sell and trade on the integrated marketplaces.

Digital assets (Artist NFTs) are player-owned NFTs minted in the ERC-721 standard, which can be used inside the AMUZED manager game.
