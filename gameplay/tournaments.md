# Tournaments

The AMUZED Fantasy Game consists of a wide variety of weekly tournaments with different rules and specifications for the lineup that the user can enter.&#x20;

### **Duration & Start Time**

A standard tournament lasts for **6 days** (Friday 0:00 until Wednesday at 23:59pm). Over the course of these six days the performance of all of the artists are tracked and afterwards the respective final scores will be published. &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
During the course of the 6 days, users will be able to see their daily "live score" per artist that is updated on an hourly basis, until the final score after the 6 days is published.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Users will have to select their lineup until 11:59pm on Thursday (local time) in order to be eligible to play. The tournament starts on the first minute of Friday, taking "[New Music Release Fridays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global\_Release\_Day)" into account.&#x20;

### Type of Tournaments

#### Standard Tournament

The standard tournament will be played every week and is the main attraction on the AMUZED platform. The standard tournament is called:

Has no additional requirements for lineups to participate. In this tournament, every artist from any geography, age, and genre can earn points for the user's lineup.&#x20;

#### Special Tournaments

In addition, there are also weekly special tournaments, that have extra requirements for the featured artists in the lineup. There can be multiple special tournaments per week and sometimes only the standard tournament will be available. This will be decided on a week by week basis by AMUZED. The requirements for these special tournaments can always be subject to change and will often change on a week by week basis. However, they will always be a combination of three categories of requirements:&#x20;

2. **Geography**: The country or region of the artists that can be chosen for the lineup by the user
3. **Genre**: The main genre of the artist that can be chosen for the lineup by the user
