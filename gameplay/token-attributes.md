# Token Attributes

Each token is unique and has different attributes (Experience Levels, Experience Points etc.) These attributes are very important for users to understand when playing the game, and making decisions for their weekly tournament lineup.

&#x20;They can be seen on the individual token page:

The higher the Experience Level, the higher the Bonus of that particular token and a higher chance to beat other.&#x20;
