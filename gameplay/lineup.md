# Lineup

The AMUZED Fantasy Game consists of weekly tournaments that users can participate in by choosing their weekly lineup of music artists.&#x20;

Before the beginning of each tournament the user has a specific timeframe (usually from Friday until Thursday at 11:59pm) in which the user can select his lineup for the upcoming tournament. The selection of the lineup is really simple, but there are a couple of requirements that are important to note.&#x20;

#### **Standard Requirements**

* Each lineup needs to have 5 artists
* The user needs to select one "[Headliner](score/headliner-bonus.md)" artist out of the five artists

#### League Rarity Requirements

Each tournament has multiple rarity leagues in which users can participate in, based on the tokens they collected and own.&#x20;

The common league is the lowest one in the weekly tournament, and Diamond is the most exclusive one -> Note: The [reward system](reward-system.md) is linked to the exclusiveness of the league.

Example: Everyone can participate in the "Common" league, whereas only users with at least 3 Diamond tokens can participate in the "Diamond" league.

There are tournaments with specific requirements. In general, there are four big categories of tournaments with different requirements. The most common tournament that is played every week is the standard tournament, but when "special" tournaments are introduced then they usually have additional requirements along the three categories of 1. Age 2. Geography 3. Genre. There can also be tournaments in which there are requirements from multiple of these categories -> For example: The tournament: "European Pop Artists under 25 years", then multiple additional requirements need to be met, when a user selects his lineup for that given tournament.&#x20;

As stated in [Tournaments](tournaments.md), there are also extra requirements/features that will be added to special tournaments in the future.
