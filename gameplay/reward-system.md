# Reward System

In addition to the fun of playing the game, following and interacting with other users and fans on the platform, there are also rewards that are paid out to well performing users in the weekly tournaments. These rewards are paid out from the [AMUZED price pool](reward-system.md#undefined).

The rewards are based on the user ranking in the weekly [leaderboard](leaderboard.md).&#x20;

**The reward system looks as follows:**&#x20;
