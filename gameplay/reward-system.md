# Reward System

In addition to the fun of playing the game, following and interacting with other users and fans on the platform, there are also rewards that are paid out to well performing users in the weekly tournaments. These rewards are paid out from the [AMUZED price pool](reward-system.md#undefined).

The rewards are based on the user ranking in the weekly [leaderboard](leaderboard.md).&#x20;

**The reward system looks as follows:**&#x20;

#### Price Pool

All of the rewards are payed out of the AMUZED price pool, which holds all available reward tokens and reward ETH.&#x20;

The price pool is filled automatically as follows:&#x20;

* 20% of artists _Glass_ tokens are not sold but reserved for the reward pool
* 10% of artists _Gold_ & _Platinum_ tokens are not sold but reserved for the reward pool
* 10% of AMUZED revenue (in ETH) on each primary market sale is distributed to the price pool for later pay out to users
