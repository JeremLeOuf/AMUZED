# Leaderboard

As stated in [Tournaments](tournaments.md#leagues) there are 5 different leagues that users can enter in every weekly tournament, depending on the collection of tokens they own. These leagues have different requirements, therefore there are also different payouts for these 5 leagues. The rewards are based on the placement of the user in the leaderboard:&#x20;

#### Dynamic Leaderboard

Over the course of a tournament, users can look at the leaderboard in order to see, where they are placed compared to other users. The leaderboard is updated on a **daily basis**, until the final day.&#x20;

#### Lineup Overview

Users can look at the lineup of other users in the ranking by simply clicking on the user. They will see the lineup with the corresponding ranking for each of the artists in the lineup.&#x20;
