# The Game Explained

When entering the AMUZED game, user will be asked to create their own "label". AMUZED users can participate in weekly games with their tokens and compete against each other by applying their insights in the music industry. They set up the (in their view) most promising artist line-up by picking five artists that will most likely generate a superior score in that given week. Users with the highest total score for their line-up of artist tokens will rank up the leaderboards and win rewards, such as new tokens.&#x20;

The score of each token is linked to the "real-life performance" of the respective artist, i.e. taking into account the artist’s overall and relative performance on streaming platforms, social media, and news channels on a week-by-week basis. The score will be generated based on extensive live data, using an algorithm to ensure that even small artists with smaller fanbases or less fan engagement have a chance to create augmented scores with their weekly activity.&#x20;

Users are encouraged to apply their industry knowledge and actively manage their artist line-up, based on how they foresee the artist’s upcoming activity in the real world.
