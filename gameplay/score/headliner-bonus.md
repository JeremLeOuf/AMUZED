# Headliner Bonus

**On AMUZED the **_**Headliner**_** is the leading artist of a lineup that is selected by the user**

Each time a user enters a [lineup](../lineup.md) to perform in a tournament he has to select one artist to be the headliner for that tournament week.&#x20;

As the headliner has a special position in a lineup and leads the other artists into competition, they are able to earn a **Headliner Bonus of **<mark style="color:red;">**5%**</mark> for a tournament week. Therefore, it makes sense for users to carefully analyse which artists should be their headliner for the specific tournament week.&#x20;

These 5% get added to the percentage bonus already accumulated by the token's experience and rarity. Together these three factors combine for the _total bonus percentage_ for a token in a given tournament week.&#x20;
